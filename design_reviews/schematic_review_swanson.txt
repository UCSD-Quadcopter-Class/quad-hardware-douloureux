Your schematic (which is not named properly) is corrupt.

The cap on your reset line is too big.

THere's one pin on your IMU  that should be connected to ground but is connected to VCC instead.  Probably the magnetometer address bit.

The motor controlled by U$9 is not connected to VBAT. The net label is misleading.

The decoupling caps on your motor controllers should be between VBAT and BAT_GND.
