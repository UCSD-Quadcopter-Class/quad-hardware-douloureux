Your schematic is not named properly.  Should be quadcopter.sch


The GNDS on the input side of your voltage regulator should be BAT_GND

Your LED symbol is conventional.

the LEDs you chose a little odd.  Are you sure you want one with a case?

Power should not be connected on the 6-pin programming header.

filter caps in power supply should be 0.1uf

Your symbol for teh MOSfet is not a normal mosfet symbol _and_ it doesn't look like the package.  I would opt for a normal mosfet symbol, but if are going to draw something that looks kind of like the package, the pins should line up with the package.


the net named "SDA" is looks like it should be part of 3V.  And the net that should be SDA is called N$1.
