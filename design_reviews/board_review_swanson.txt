commit 31284d968fca0c2debc7e28cd229677303ac0adc

Power

THe wires between your battery, the jumper, BAT_GND, the VBAT and BAT_GND planes,  and the voltage regulater need to be high current need the high current.


DRC

The "width" errors for the signal to your antenna should be fixed rather than approved.

Motor holders

ok

Pours

You need one continuous pour that surrounds all the antenna driver circuity.  Look at the red board.

Also, it's better if you have a separate ground pour on layer 2 under the antenna driver.  It can be the same size and shape as the ground pour on Top.

You need separate pours for GND and BAT_GND.  They can be the same size and shape as 3V and VBAT.

DRC is not complaining, but it'd be safer if the gap between the VBAT and 3V planes was wider.  It's very narrow in a couple places.

Antenna

The wire between C8 and the antenna and the balun should be shorter.  check the red board.

Oscillator

THe oscillator needs to match the layout on the red board.

decoupling

your decoupling caps are too far from the micro controller and IMU.  The caps for each part should be as close as possible to the ICs.

Voltage regulator

ok.

Reset button

You have no reset button.

Jumper

ok.

Misc


A bunch of your wires are thicker than they need to be. e.g., RESET and the PWM lines should be minimum width.  It'll make routing easier.  Use the auto router.
