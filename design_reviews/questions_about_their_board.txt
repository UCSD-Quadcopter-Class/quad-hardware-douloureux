Battery: The design includes a wire bridge that connects BAT_GND to GND.
The reason for this resistor is to ensure that noise from the motors 
(which are connected to the BAT_GND) does not impact the microcontroller. 
In order for this work, you need to place the bridge as close to both the
battery and the voltage regulator as possible.  This will ensure that the 
regulated ground has the shortest possible connection to the negative 
battery terminal.

Antenna: Antenna should be as CLOSE as possible to the driver, we think 
you can push the driver and antenna even closer because the wire at the 
moment might be too long

IMU: We want a solid layer of GND underneath the IMU and we don't want any 
wires to run underneath it.  You can accomplish this with a combination pours 
and geometry in  tRestrict and bRestrict.
	Seems like there is a wire going underneath the imu in the top layer

Antenna:  RFSIG should only be the wire between balun and antenna

Antenna: One of the antenna's pads should be surrounded by the pours

IMU: Capacitor placement is misplaced, check data sheet for the orientation

Based on the orientation of the IMU, it will effect the X or Plus drive of your 
copter

Microcontroller: the capacitor placement should somewhat match the placement 
of the original redboard
Decoupling cap should be located as close as possible to power pin of micro controller

The Cup that holds the motor needs to be 8.5mm? I measured 8.04

DRC has 1k errors
