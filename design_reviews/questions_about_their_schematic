Jason W & Zhe met with Jason S & Connie at Envision lab @ 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm and then 
moved to the library from 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm and discussed parts missing, wires not 
being connected, how and where tkeepout + tplace should be, and how pads should be 
1mm away from the actual device for soldering purposes. 

Need to connect PB5, PB6, PB7 -> you may need to label your entire microcontroller 
to how it was orginally labeled because in the future we might be connecting them 
to more parts we will build later on.

Following pin 8 and 9 of the microcontroller, instructions said to replace the two 
capacitors and connect the two ends with just wires.
We are unsure of pin 14 and pin 15 of the microcontroller, why do u need an led?

IMU
Connect SDA and SCL of IMU to microcontroller, not power, no resistors are needed.

Motor
Each motor is not driven by the PB5 pin as the pulse width, since the gimbal will 
be sending out the individual signals, they should be connected to other ports in 
the microcontroller such as PE5, PE3, PE4, PB5.

Battery 
Pin 4 of the voltage regulator might need a capacitor before it leads into GND.

Libraries
LED.lbr
Is the pad size of your LED correct?

Connie.lbr
Is the pad size of your LED’s correct?
Need to have silk screen and make sure the parts follow how the pads are placed 
upright, 1mm away from the actual device.
Then the dimension of the entire part should be encased by the tkeepout layer
It seems not every part of your schematic is correct, at least one thing has to 
be done for each i.e for yours or Jason’s the IMU’s pads either were extended in 
the wrong direction or the keepout layer did not encase the entire device
