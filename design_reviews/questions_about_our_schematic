Meeting Time/Place: 4 - 6:30, 04/24/17, Envision Lab and Price Center
Schematic:

Connectivity:
ERC check has 86 warnings.
	Unconnected wires/pins, missing junctions.
		i.e. at D5, D6, P$19, etc...
	Floating/useless wire segments.
		i.e. btwn D6 and R3
Motor controllers should be connected to VBAT and BAT_GND
Need a net bridge connecting gnd and bat_gnd
Diode in motor controllers should be Schottky diode, not LED?
Breakout header pins should be the same pins that are connected
from the motor controllers to the microcontroller

Functionality:
	No current-limiting resistor for LED_S1, 2, 3, 4?
		forward voltages of 2.2-2.6, 2.1-2.5, 2.0-2.5
	replace LEDs D5 and D6
	CS pins on IMU not connected to VDDIO (select I2C?)
	ISP should not be connected to power

Libraries:

LED in LEDs.lbr
	Package:
		Nothing in tPlace?
			part outline
			device orientation (i.e. mark anode)
		Nothing in tDocu?
			actual part line/dimensions
		Nothing in tNames?
			>Name
		Nothing in tValues?
			>Value
		Be sure to use vector font.
Device:
Shouldn’t you create variants for your 3 different colors?
Part number should probably be 67-1374-1-ND instead 
of 67-1374-2-ND (tape and reel with minimum 1000 units to purchase).



IMU
	Package:
		I think the inner outline is supposed to be in tDocu?
		(not sure it matters)
		Pad location/size doesn’t look right.
		Aren’t pads supposed to extend 1mm from device?
	Device:
		Missing prefix
MOSFET
	Symbol:
		Missing Value? 
		(The parts list specifies a value for it.)
	Package:
		Value?
		Nothing in tPlace?
			Outline
			pin 1 indicator
		Nothing in tDocu?
			pad placement
			need to extend out from device by 1mm?
	Device:
		Value on?
		Missing prefix
